# AutoHotkey Script Search Tool & Indexer

![Preview](https://github.com/elModo7/Script-Search-Tool/blob/main/res/img/sample2.gif?raw=true)

I have **so many scripts** that ***it's become harder and harder to find what I want*** over the years.
This tool aims at addressing just that, you can search by file name or folder (that's how I have been using it so far), and now [this repo gave me the idea of having a preview and content search.](https://github.com/Ixiko/AHK-CodeSearch)

It creates an SQLite database of a specific folder (recursive) and indexes the file contents so that future searchs are pretty much instant.

There are two variants, one with the GUI purely made in AutoHotkey (*above*) and another one with a more visually appealing UI but no file preview (*below*).

> [!NOTE] 
> I have included my script index so as for you to have a small demo, but you will have to clear the config if you want to use the script on your own file system.
> You can do that through the tray menu once opened.

> [!WARNING] 
> This code is really really old, it is in Spanglish and full of copy-pastes from when I was starting to learn AutoHotkey, use it for the functionality alone, but the code base is terrific for learning or extending from it.
> If you improve it, feel free do make a pull request!
